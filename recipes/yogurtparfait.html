    <h1>Steps in Preparing this Recipe </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate and organize your ingredients. You'll find the ingredients in a list above. <br>The great thing about 
            parfait ingredients is that it is completely customizable.<br> 
            Keep them in a place near each other on your work station.</li>
        <li>Place the glass in the middle. <br>You'll be putting the ingredients in this container,
             so try to keep it near the food items. 
             <br>Chill this glass beforehand in the freezer or fridge. <br>This makes the food cool and keeps it fresh.</li>
        <li>Add a quarter cup of yogurt. Don't add all of the yogurt yet; you still
             need room in the glass for the other ingredients. <br>At this point, you may 
             add any other ingredients to the parfait. <br>It is your choice; this is what makes a parfait so unique. <br>You can add strawberry 
            jam for some sweetness, cereal, oatmeal, granola, fruit, or whatever else 
            you like.<br> Be sure to leave some room in the cup for the final step.</li>
        <li>Add the other three-fourths of a cup of yogurt. <br>You want to have more yogurt on the top than on the bottom.<br> 
            If you have too much on the bottom all of your cereal and fruit will sink and get soggy in the yogurt.<br>
            I recommend using plain yogurt so the real flavor of the ingredients come out <br>but if you want to intensify 
            the taste of the fruit then add a flavored yogurt. You can substitute a flavored yogurt for a fruit.<br> 
            Serve the dish fresh, preferably right after you have prepared it.<br>
            If you don't like I said the granola or cereal will get soggy.</li>
        <li>Finished <br>your recipe is finally ready</li>
